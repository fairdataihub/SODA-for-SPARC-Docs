## Background

Workspaces are a way to organize datasets and Pennsieve users into groups. A workspace is only accessible through invitation from the workspace Owner or Administrator. Once part of a workspace you can access datasets based on your access rights. Your access rights are determined by your Workspace Role. For more information on Workspace Roles and workpsace management see the official Pennsieve documentation [here](https://docs.pennsieve.io/docs/workspace-management#multiple-workspaces).

## How SODA for SPARC Handles Workspaces

SODA for SPARC will automatically utilize your default workspace after you have connected your account with Pennsieve.
If you have access to only one workspace then that workspace is your default workspace. If you have access to multiple workspaces then in most cases the default workspace is the workspace you last accessed on Pennsieve. Any work you do in SODA for SPARC will be done for a dataset in your default workspace.

## How to Change Workspaces Within SODA for SPARC

For users with access to more than one workspace it is possible to switch between workspace within SODA for SPARC. To switch workspaces in Free Form Mode simply select a feature, and then select the workspace field. This will open a dropdown menu where you can select the workspaces from the list of workspaces you have access to. Enter your email and password to enable the workspace switch.

In Guided Mode you will be asked to verify your workspace before you can proceed with a dataset upload. Like in Free Form Mode you can select your available workspaces from a dropdown menu. Enter your email and password to enable the workspace switch.
