## Background

The Curation Team has release templates for all the metadata files required in SPARC datasets. These templates are available in SPARC Dataset Structure which may be [downloaded as a zip file](https://github.com/SciCrunch/sparc-curation/releases/tag/dataset-template-2.1.0). They are used by SODA when generating the metadata files. You can also download them conveniently in this SODA feature in case you wish to fill them out manually.

## How to

To access this interface click on the `Download SDS template` button at the bottom of the home page,
then you will be given the option to download the templates for the metadata files required in SPARC
datasets along with the high level folders or the metadata files only.

Simply click on the option you would prefer and select the destination folder to download.
