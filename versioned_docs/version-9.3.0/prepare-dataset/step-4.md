Click on the applicable panel to include the high-level metadata files of your choice. For example, to include a submission file in your dataset, simply click on the `submission` panel and you will be taken to a separate page to either import or drag & drop your file into SODA. Click `Confirm` to finish the importing process. To remove a metadata file you previously imported, click on the corresponding panel and click `Remove`.

:::info
submission, dataset_description, subjects, and README.txt files are mandatory for all datasets. The samples file is mandatory if applicable. The other files are optional.

## Code-related metadata files

If you specify a code high level folder at Step 2: Specify high-level folders, you will be able to import the code-related metadata files: `code_description`, `inputs_metadata`, and `outputs_metadata`.

:::info
If you start with an existing local or Pennsieve dataset that has existing SPARC metadata files, these files will be automatically extracted and loaded here. Replace these existing files by uploading new ones or simply remove them from this step if required.
