## Background

All SPARC datasets must have the following metadata: subtitle, description, banner image, license, and tags. This interface allows you to easily assign the [Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license to your dataset, which is mandatory for all SPARC datasets.

## How to

To access this interface click on the `Curate and Share` side bar option, then click on the `Free Form Curation` button and within the `Manage Datasets` tab click on the `Assign a license` card.

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Select/confirm your Workspace. Learn more about workspaces [here](../../how-to/how-to-use-workspaces.md).
3. Click on `Assign Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license`. This button will only be visible if the CC-BY 4.0 license is not already assigned, otherwise you will see "Creative Commons Attribution" mentioned under "Current License" and you don't need to do anything else.
