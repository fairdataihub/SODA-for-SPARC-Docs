## Background

The Curation Team has release templates for all the metadata files required in SPARC datasets. These templates are available in SPARC Dataset Structure which may be [downloaded as a zip file](https://github.com/SciCrunch/sparc-curation/releases/tag/dataset-template-1.2.3). They are used by SODA when generating the metadata files. You can also download them conveniently in this SODA feature in case you wish to fill them out manually.

## How to

To access this interface click on the `Curate and Share` side bar option, then click on the `Free Form Curation` button and within the `Prepare Metadata` tab,
click on the `Download templates` card.

Simply click on the name of the file and select the destination folder to download.
