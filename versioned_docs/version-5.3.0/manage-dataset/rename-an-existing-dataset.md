# Rename an existing dataset

## Background

You can rename an existing dataset on Pennsieve through this feature of SODA. The name of the dataset will be displayed as the title of the dataset when the dataset becomes public. It is thus advised to make sure that your dataset title is different than your other dataset titles and that it is relatively informative.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and the dataset that you wish to rename. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Enter a new name and click `Rename`.
