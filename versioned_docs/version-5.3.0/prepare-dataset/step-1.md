# Step 1: Getting started

Select between the following 4 options to get started with your dataset organization process with SODA:

1. **Prepare a new dataset**: Select this option if you want to start organizing and curating a new dataset. SODA will take you step-by-step through the curation process to organize your dataset, adding your metadata files, and generating your dataset onto Pennsieve.
2. **Continue with a previously initiated dataset in SODA**: Select this option if you previously saved your progress in SODA and would like to continue working on it.
3. **Continue working on an existing local dataset**: Select this option if you have a local dataset stored on your computer that you want to continue working on. Existing high-level SPARC folders and metadata files will be automatically extracted and loaded into SODA so you can continue working on them.
4. **Continue working on an existing Pennsieve dataset**: Select this option if you have an existing dataset on Pennsieve that you want to continue working on. Existing high-level SPARC folders and metadata files will be automatically extracted and loaded into SODA so you can continue working on them.
