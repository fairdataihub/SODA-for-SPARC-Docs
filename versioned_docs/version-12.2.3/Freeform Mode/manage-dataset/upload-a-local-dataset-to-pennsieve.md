## Background

With this feature, you can upload a data from your computer on to a Pennsieve dataset (with folder structure preserved). If the dataset is not structured according to the SPARC Data Structure, SODA will not be able to upload it. You can find out more about the SPARC Data Structure [here](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/overview-of-sparc-dataset-format#organization-of-a).

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Select/confirm your Workspace. Learn more about workspaces [here](../../how-to/how-to-use-workspaces.md).
3. Click on `Select a folder` and select the local dataset folder in the navigation window..
4. Click on `Upload dataset`. The progress bar will indicate the upload progress until it is completed

:::note
When uploading your local dataset to Pennsieve SODA will now allow you to perform other curation tasks. You can track your progress, as well as return to the `Upload a Local Dataset to Pennsieve` page, by utilizing the new `Navigation Progress Bar`.
