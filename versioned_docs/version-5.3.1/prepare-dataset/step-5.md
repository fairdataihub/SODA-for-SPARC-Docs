title: Step 5 - Request manifest files
---

Manifest files are mandatory for all datasets. To learn more about this metadata file we refer to our corresponding "[How to](../how-to/how-to-structure-the-manifest-metadata-file.md)" page.

To generate and include manifest files automatically, simply toggle the option to `Yes`. Then, when you generate the dataset (Step 6), a **manifest.xlsx** file will be added to each high-level SPARC folder with the **filename**, **timestamp**, and **file type** fields automatically populated in the correct format while the **description** and **Additional Metadata** fields will be filled when specified during Step 3.

:::caution
Any existing manifest files at the target location for generating the dataset will be replaced.
