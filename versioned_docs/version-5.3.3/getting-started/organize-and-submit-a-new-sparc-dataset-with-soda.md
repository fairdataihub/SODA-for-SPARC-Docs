title: Organize and submit a new SPARC dataset
---

## Background

This is the suggested workflow for preparing and submitting your SPARC datasets with SODA using the Free Form Mode features (accessible from the sidebar). All these steps are mandatory (unless marked otherwise) if you wish to satisfy the SPARC requirements. Once you complete these steps, your datasets will be curated according to the SPARC guidelines and summited to the SPARC Curation Team for review.

## Prepare Dataset on Pennsieve

### Connect your Pennsieve account with SODA

This is only required the first time you use SODA. This step will be automatically requested from you when you start SODA if you haven't connected to Pennsieve. You can also trigger this step manually by clicking the edit (pencil icon image) button at any of the Current account fields in SODA. We would suggest using the one found under the `Create a new dataset option` at `Free Form Mode > Manage Datasets`.

### Create a new dataset

To create a new dataset on Pennsieve, use the Create a new dataset option under `Free Form Mode > Manage Datasets`.

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a92ee77f878c7668dd59628100ebdb12fbe4d3aba92479b720d121ce756438dc/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f426756384c76762f696d6167652e706e67)

You can then confirm your details in the account step. Type out the name of the dataset you want to create on Pennsieve and click on `Create dataset`.

:::info
You can use the navigation buttons in the bottom right corner of the app to go through all the mandatory steps needed to curate a dataset. These buttons will follow the same steps as detailed in this guide.

### Make PI of the SPARC award the owner of the dataset

By default, the creator of the dataset (you) is the owner. As per SPARC guidelines, the PI of your award needs to be the owner of the dataset. You can use the feature `Make PI owner of dataset` under the `Manage Datasets` tab to accomplish this task. The dataset you created during step A2 should be automatically selected (you can select another one by clicking on the pencil symbol next to `Current dataset`). Simply select your dataset PI from the dropdown list and click on `Make PI owner` (read and click `Yes` in the warning prompt) to make them the owner.

### Give access to other members/teams who may need to contribute to the dataset

Your dataset may require additional people or teams to be given permission to access the dataset. You can use the feature `Add/edit permissions` under the `Manage Datasets` tab to accomplish this task. Currently given permissions will be visible under `Current permissions`. To add additional permissions for teammates, click on `Add/edit user permissions`, select your teammate's name from the first dropdown list, select their desired permission/role from the second dropdown list, and click on `Add permissions for user`. Repeat to add more teammates.

## Prepare SPARC Metadata Files

### Prepare submission file

You can use the feature `Create submission.xlsx` under the `Prepare Metadata` tab to accomplish this task. Select `I want to prepare a new submission.xlsx` file, then fill out the three required fields for this metadata file.

1. Enter your award number. We recommend connecting your Airtable account with SODA so you can import your award number automatically and without error from the SPARC Airtable sheet (this will also come in handy later on when adding contributors to the dataset_description metadata file). To do that:
   - Click on `Click here to import my SPARC award from Airtable`
     ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bfcf10546da716ccabee27be5974a562bbfc6f3d4e26b5d5558fcc3076e54573/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f44396658344e732f696d6167652e706e67)
   - Click `Yes` on the pop-up for adding an Airtable account connection. You need to enter your Airtable API key in SODA to connect your account. To find your Airtable key, please visit [your account](https://airtable.com/account) (login if necessary) and click the `Generate API Key` button. If you see a `Regenerate API key` option you may click on the box with the dots to reveal your API key. Copy it and paste it in the dedicated field in the SODA pop-up box (click `Yes` if a warning prompt shows up).

## Organize dataset according to the SPARC Dataset Structure

### Background

All SPARC datasets must follow the top-level SPARC folder structure imposed by the How to. This top-level folder structure is shown in the figure below. If your data organization doesn't follow this structure inherently, you can create it virtually with SODA and then generate it directly on Pennsieve.

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Prepare-dataset/Specify-files/SPARC-dataset-structure.PNG?raw=true)

You can use the feature `Organize dataset` under the `Prepare Datasets` tab to accomplish this task.

### Step 1: Getting Started

Click on `Prepare a new dataset`. This option is used to start organizing and curating a new dataset. SODA will take you step-by-step through the curation process to organize your dataset, adding your metadata files, and generating your dataset onto Pennsieve.

### Step 2: Specify high-level folders

Select the high-level folder(s) to be included in your dataset. Refer to the description provided in the figure here about the content of each folder to determine which folder you need for your dataset. A high-level folder can only be included from Step 2 and removed from Step 3. You can always come back to this step to include more folders.

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Organize-dataset/high-level-folders-1.gif?raw=true)

### Step 3: Structure dataset files

Virtually structure your dataset using this interface as if you were organizing it on your computer but without actually modifying any local files. All your requested actions (files to be included, folders to be created, metadata information to be added, etc.) will be registered by SODA and only implemented when the dataset is generated during Step 6.

These are some of the functions you can do while you are in this step:

- Go inside a folder by double-clicking on it.
- Import files/folders inside a folder using drag-and-drop or the `Import` menu located in the upper right corner.
- Create a new folder using the `New folder` button located in the upper right corner. Note that this is only possible inside a high-level SPARC folder. To create a new high-level SPARC folder, go back to Step 2.
- Rename files/folders using the right-click menu option `Rename`.
- Remove files/folders using the right-click menu option `Delete`.
- Move files/folders using the right-click menu option `Move`.
- Multiple-select files/folders by either drag-selecting items or holding Ctrl and clicking items.
- Use the arrow located in the upper left corner to move up a folder. The current location in the dataset is indicated right next to the arrow.

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Organize-dataset/organize-step3-part1.gif?raw=true)

#### Adding file descriptions (optional)

Use the `Details` option from the right-click menu to see the actual path of the file and include metadata (description, Additional Metadata) which will be included in the manifest files if you request SODA to generate them automatically for you (Step 5).

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Organize-dataset/organize-step3-part2-files.gif?raw=true)

### Step 4: Specify high-level metadata files

Click on the applicable panel to include the high-level metadata files of your choice.
:::info
submission, dataset_description, and subjects files are mandatory for all datasets. The samples file is mandatory if applicable. The other files are optional.
:::

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Organize-dataset/organize-step4-metadata-files.gif?raw=true)

### Step 5: Request manifest files

To generate and include the mandatory manifest files automatically, simply toggle the option to `Yes`.

:::caution
Any existing manifest files at the target location for generating the dataset will be replaced.

### Step 6: Generate dataset

Click on the `Generate directly on Pennsieve` option and confirm your account.

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4fc9c5a061ed9992f3cef118c0b46a049bb613aef9e9a4c2a7016355141892ad/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f797962776842482f696d6167652e706e67)

Select `I want to generate on an existing dataset`. If your dataset is not already selected, click on the edit icon next to Current dataset and select the dataset that you created previously.

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Organize-dataset/generate-3.gif?raw=true)

### Step 7: Preview dataset

This step serves as a confirmation page before SODA generates your dataset. You can preview your dataset organization with specified SPARC metadata files and specified dataset generate options. This is how your dataset will look once it is generated either on Pennsieve. To edit any details from this step, simply click on the Edit icon next to a section. This will bring you back to the associated section for edits.

![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Organize-dataset/preview-dataset.PNG?raw=true)

When you are ready to generate your dataset, click the Generate button. Wait here until the dataset is generated.

Once the dataset is generated, you will be prompted to share it with the Curation Team. Click on Yes.

## Submit Dataset to the Curation Team for Review

You can find this feature under `Share with Curation Team` under the `Disseminate Dataset` tab. The dataset you created during step A2 should be automatically selected (you can select another one by clicking on the pencil symbol next to `Current dataset`). Simply click on `Share now` to share your dataset with the Curation Team for review.

You are now done! Wait to hear back from the Curation Team.
