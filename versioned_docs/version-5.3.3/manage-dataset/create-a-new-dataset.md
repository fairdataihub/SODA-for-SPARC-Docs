---

## Background

You can create a new dataset on Pennsieve through this feature of SODA. The name of the dataset will be displayed as the title of the dataset when the dataset becomes public. It is thus advised to make sure that your dataset title is different than your other dataset titles and that it is relatively informative.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Enter the desired name for the dataset.
3. Click `Create dataset`.
