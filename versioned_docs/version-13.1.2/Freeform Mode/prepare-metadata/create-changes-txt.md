## Background

Under this feature, SODA lets you rapidly prepare the CHANGES metadata file, which is required if you are preparing a new version of an already published dataset.

## How to

To access this interface click on the `Curate and Share` side bar option, then click on the `Free Form Curation` button and within the `Prepare Metadata` tab,
click on the `CHANGES.txt` card.

1. You can start by either Creating a CHANGES file from scratch with SODA or Continue working on an existing CHANGES.txt file.

   - If you want to continue working on an existing CHANGES.txt file, you will be prompted to either import it from your computer, or specify a Pennsieve dataset
     where the file is currently located. SODA will load information from such CHANGES file for further edits at your convenience.

2. In the text-area, enter the information to be included in your CHANGES.txt file.

3. Review and click on `Generate` to generate your CHANGES file. You have the options to generate and save it on your computer or generate and upload it directly
   to Pennsieve. If your dataset is not organized yet, you can save this file anywhere on your computer then import it in SODA when prompted in the
   [Organize dataset](../prepare-dataset/organize-dataset) feature.
