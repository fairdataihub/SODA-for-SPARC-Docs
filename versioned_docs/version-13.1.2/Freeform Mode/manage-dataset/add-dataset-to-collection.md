## Background

A collection allows you to associate and consolidate multiple datasets into a single grouping. By doing so, you can catalog your datasets in a myriad of ways, including by scientific theme, by publication, and more. Ultimately, this can allow for better organization of your datasets and provides the ability to streamline collaboration by providing a link to a collection instead of multiple, distinct datasets.

## How to

:::info
All collection names that belong to the organization will be shown as an option. You can only modify datasets for which you are the owner/manager.
:::

To access this interface click on the `Curate and Share` side bar option, then click on the `Free Form Curation` button and within the `Manage Datasets` tab, click on the
`Add dataset to a collection` card.

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](../../connecting-to-pennsieve/connecting-with-username-password).
2. Select/confirm your Workspace. Learn more about workspaces [here](../../how-to/how-to-use-workspaces.md).
3. Add/delete collection names:
   - A list of collection names that have already been created will appear as a list of suggestions for you to choose.
   - To create a new collection name type any collection name that you feel captures the nature of your dataset as a collection name. Once you have entered the text for a single collection name, press `Enter` or click off the textbox to add it.
   - Delete a collection by clicking the `x` to the right of a given collection name.
4. Click on the `Update collections` button.
