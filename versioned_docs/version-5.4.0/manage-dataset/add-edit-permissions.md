## Background

There are four roles available for a dataset: owner, manager, editor, and viewer. Each of them provides different permissions for making changes to a dataset. These permissions are summarized in the table below. You can find out more about permissions on the associated [Pennsieve help page](https://docs.pennsieve.io/docs/dataset-permissions).

When you create a dataset, it is private and accessible only to you (you have `owner` permissions on the dataset). You can change who can access and modify your dataset by giving permissions to members or entire teams.
