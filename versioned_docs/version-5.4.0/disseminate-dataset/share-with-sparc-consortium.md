Once your dataset is approved by the Curation Team, it is ready to be shared with the SPARC Consortium as embargoed dataset. Sharing will give `viewer` permissions to any SPARC investigator who has signed the SPARC Non-disclosure form and will allow them to see your data. They will then be able to view and download your dataset from Pennsieve.

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](../manage-dataset/connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Click on `Share now` to share your dataset with the SPARC Consortium.
