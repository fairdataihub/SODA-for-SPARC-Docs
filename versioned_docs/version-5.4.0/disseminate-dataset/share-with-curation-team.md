## Background

Sharing your dataset with the Curation Team must be done only when your dataset is ready to be reviewed. Sharing with the SPARC Curation Team will give them `manager` permissions, which is necessary for them to review your dataset, and set the dataset status to `03. Ready for Curation` (see our documentation on [dataset status](../manage-dataset/view-and-change-status.md)) thus adding the dataset to the Curation Team's queue for review. It is then highly recommended to not make any changes to your dataset.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](../manage-dataset/connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Click on `Share now` to add your dataset to the Curation team's review queue.
