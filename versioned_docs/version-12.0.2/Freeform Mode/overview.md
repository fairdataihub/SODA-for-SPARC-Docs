### About

If you are making only a few changes to an existing dataset (for example based on feedback from the SPARC Curation Team), you can use the `Free Form Curation` mode. This mode provides various feature for creating/editing individual compoenents of a dataset. This mode should only be used if you are familiar with the SPARC data curation and sharing guidelines, otherwise we strongly recommend using the `End to End Curation` mode.

### Using the Free Form Curation mode

Click on the `Curate and Share` option of the sidebar and then click on `Free Form Curation`.

There are four pages accessible through the top menu bar:

- `Manage Datasets`: You will find here features to create/modify datasets on Pennsieve (create a new dataset, add/edit a banner image, etc.). There is also a feature to upload dataset which can be used e.g. if you have already organized your dataset according to the SDS and all you want to do is upload it.
- `Prepare Metadata`: You will find here feature to individually prepare the metadata files requires in the SDS (dataset description file, manifest files, etc.). There is also a feature to download the latest templates of these metadata files.
- `Prepare Datasets`: You will find here features to structure your dataset according to the SDS and validate it.
- `Disseminate Datasets`: You will find here a feature to share your dataset with the SPARC Curation Team for their review.

Help pages for the different features are accessible from the "Free Form Curation" menu of this document.
