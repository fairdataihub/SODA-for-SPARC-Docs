### What are the FAIR SPARC Data Guidelines?

All SPARC-funded researchers must curate their datasets following the SPARC Data Standards (SDS) and share them openly on the Pennsieve data platform as per their funding agreement with SPARC. [Learn more about SDS here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.10.430563).

### What are the challenges?

The guidelines are very exhaustive to maximize FAIRness of SPARC datasets but are challenging and time-consuming for researchers to implement.

### What does SODA for SPARC do?

SODA for SPARC combines intuitive user interfaces and automation such that researchers can efficiently and accurately curate their SPARC datasets.
