## Background

SODA supports uploading datasets to Pennsieve for users that only have guest access to a Pennsieve workspace.
However, due to the Pennsieve permissions a guest user cannot create their own dataset on Pennsieve. Instead, they will need to have a dataset created for them by a contributor or associate who has the appropriate permissions to create datasets in the workspace. This contributor or associate may be a colleague or team member who has the necessary access rights. For many the contributor or associate will be a member of the SPARC curation team.

This page shows you how to upload a dataset as a Pennsieve guest using SODA.

## Steps to Upload to a dataset shared with you using the Prepare Dataset Step by Step feature

1. From the homepage click the `Prepare Dataset Step by Step` button.
2. Click the `Prepare and optionally share a new dataset` button.
3. Enter a dataset name and description. NOTE: This dataset name will not be used for the dataset name on Pennsieve but will be used for the progress file. The progress file allows you to click the 'Save & Exit' button and resume curating your dataset later.
4. Navigate through the steps until you reach the 'Generate Dataset' section and find yourself on the 'Options' page.
5. Select 'Generate dataset on Pennsieve'
6. You will be prompted to connect your Pennsieve account with SODA.
7. On the 'Pennsieve Dataset' page select 'Upload to an existing empty dataset on Pennsieve' and choose the dataset that was shared with you from the dropdown menu.
   Note: If you do not see any datasets please see the section below.
8. Follow the remaining steps and upload your dataset to Pennsieve.

### I do not see the dataset I want to upload to in the dropdown menu

If the dataset you want to upload to does not appear in the dropdown menu, please try the following:

- Check with the researcher who shared the dataset with you to confirm you have been given 'Editor' or 'Manager' permissions.
- Check that you are in the correct workspace. For example, if the dataset was created in the 'SPARC' workspace you should see in SODA on the 'Pennsieve Log in' page that
  you are in the 'SPARC' workspsace.

## Steps to Upload to a dataset shared with you using the Upload Dataset feature

### I do not see the dataset I want to upload to in the dropdown menu

If the dataset you want to upload to does not appear in the dropdown menu, please try the following:

- Check with the researcher who shared the dataset with you to confirm you have been given 'Editor' or 'Manager' permissions.

  you are in the 'SPARC' workspsace.
