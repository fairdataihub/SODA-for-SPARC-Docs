## Background

SODA make use of the [SPARC Airtable sheet](https://airtable.com/tblFGEvUoTbbG6tJy/viwWBpydzfYQsvNFz?blocks=hide) to automatically get award numbers and contributors information such that you don't have to enter them manually in your metadata file. To enable this, you have to connect your Airtable account with SODA. You will only have to do that one time, SODA will then automatically connect to your Airtable account during subsequent uses.

We suggest keeping your group information up to date in the Airtable sheet, especially contributors' names, email, affiliations, and ORCID to help SODA help you!

## How to

1. Create an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/).
2. Get access to the [SPARC Airtable sheet](https://airtable.com/tblFGEvUoTbbG6tJy/viwWBpydzfYQsvNFz?blocks=hide) (contact Dr. Charles Horn at [chorn@pitt.edu](mailto:chorn@pitt.edu)).
3. Under the `Create submission.xlsx` feature from the `Prepare Metadata` section, start by either Creating a submission file from scratch with SODA or Continue working on an existing submission.xlsx file. Click on `Click here to import my SPARC award from Airtable` to connect SODA with your Airtable account.
4. Enter your Airtable API key in the dedicated SODA interface. Checkout the [Airtable Help page](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219046777-How-do-I-get-my-API-key) to learn how to obtain or re-generate your API key.
5. Click on `Add account`.

:::info
You will have to do this only once and the Airtable connection will be then remembered by SODA during subsequent uses. Your Airtable key will be stored locally on your computer and the SODA Team will not have access to it.
