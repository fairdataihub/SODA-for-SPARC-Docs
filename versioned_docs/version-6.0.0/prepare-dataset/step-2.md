Select the high-level folder(s) to be included in your dataset. If you started with an existing dataset (local or Pennsieve), any high-level folder included in that dataset will be automatically selected at this step.

:::tip
Refer to the [description provided in the figure](./organize-dataset#background) about the content of each high-level folder to determine which folder you need for your dataset.

:::info
A high-level folder can only be included from Step 2 and removed from Step 3. You can always come back to this step to include more folders; however, in order to delete a high level folder from your dataset, you have to delete it at Step 3 by right-clicking on the folder and click Delete.
