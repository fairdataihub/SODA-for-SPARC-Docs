SODA (Software to Organize Data Automatically) for SPARC is a cross-platform desktop software that allows biomedical researchers to easily make their data [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792175/) by implementing the SPARC data curation and sharing guidelines.

### What is SPARC?

The NIH's Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program seeks to accelerate development of therapeutic devices that modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ function. You can [learn more about SPARC here](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc). A major goal of SPARC is to make data issued from the program FAIR such that it is broadly reusable. This is achieved by imposing the SPARC data curation and sharing guidelines.

### What are the SPARC data curation and sharing guidelines?

All SPARC-funded researchers must curate their data following the [SPARC Data Standards (SDS)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.10.430563) and share them openly on the [SPARC Data Portal](https://sparc.science/). This worklow for making data FAIR is supported by several tools, including SODA for SPARC. The workflow and tools are now open to everyone, even for researchers not funded by SPARC desiring to make their data FAIR.

### What are the challenges?

The SPARC data curation and sharing guidelines are very exhaustive (standard data structure, metadata, ontologies, etc.) to maximize FAIRness of data but are consequently challenging and time-consuming for researchers to implement.

### What does SODA for SPARC do?

SODA for SPARC combines intuitive user interfaces and automation such that researchers can easily and efficiently implement the SPARC data curation and sharing guidelines to make their data FAIR.
