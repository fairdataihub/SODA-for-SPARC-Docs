## Overview

To better follow the FAIR standards and be more transparent in all aspects of the versioning and archival process we map every version of our documentation with the appropriate version of SODA for SPARC. Since our documentation is versioned and released automatically using [Semantic releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), this page should list every matched version.

## Versions
