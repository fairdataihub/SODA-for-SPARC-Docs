## Overview Page

The overview page is the starting page of SODA. From here, you can rapidly acess the sections of the app through the quick access buttons (elements 2 in the image below) such as the documentation page to learn about the user interface, Guide Mode for curating new datasets, and Free Form Mode for modifying existing datasets. These sections and other can also be accessed through the sidebar (element 1 in the image below).

## Guided Mode

Throughout Guided Mode you will be taken through a series of steps to automate and ease the process of curating a new dataset. Datasets that have been started but not uploaded yet will be shown at the bottom of the section with the option to continue curating.

## Free Form Mode

Free Form Mode is available to freely modify standalone sections of the dataset curation process. With datasets already on Pennsieve you can edit them if needed by clicking on the top section called "Prepare Datasets" and select "Continue working on an existing Pennsieve dataset".
Similarly you can modify the metadata of a dataset by selecting the tab "Prepare Metadata" the the top.
