# Checklist to organize and submit SPARC datasets

## Prepare and submit SPARC datasets with SODA

This is the suggested workflow for preparing and submitting your SPARC datasets with SODA using the Free Form Mode features. All these steps are mandatory (unless marked otherwise) if you wish to satisfy the SPARC requirements.

### Preliminary steps

These steps only need to be completed once after you install the application.

- Read about the [SPARC requirements for organizing and sharing all SPARC datasets](https://sparc.science/help/7k8nEPuw3FjOq2HuS8OVsd)
- Sign up to [Pennsieve](https://app.pennsieve.net/) and get access to the SPARC Consortium organization (contact support@pennsieve.net for help)
- Download and install the [Pennsieve agent](https://docs.pennsieve.io/docs/the-pennsieve-agent) required to upload files through SODA
- Open SODA and watch our quick video located under the `Overview` tab to familiarize yourself with the user interface of SODA

### Prepare Dataset on Pennsieve

These steps can be completed in the `Manage Datasets` tab of SODA.

- [Connect your Pennsieve account with SODA](../manage-dataset/connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda). This is only required the first time you use SODA
- [Create a new dataset](../manage-dataset/create-a-new-dataset)
- [Make PI of the SPARC award the owner of the dataset](../manage-dataset/make-pi-owner-of-dataset).
- [Give access to other members/teams who may need to contribute to the dataset](../manage-dataset/add-edit-permissions) (note: optional)
- [Add a subtitle](../manage-dataset/add-edit-subtitle)
- [Add a description](../manage-dataset/add-edit-description)
- [Upload a banner image](../manage-dataset/upload-a-banner-image)
- [Assign a license](../manage-dataset/assign-a-license)

### Prepare SPARC Metadata Files

These steps can be completed in the `Prepare Metadata` tab of SODA.

- Prepare protocol on protocols.io following the [instructions provided here](https://sparc.science/help/1slXZSS2XtTYQsdY6mEJi5).
- [Prepare submission file](../prepare-metadata/create-submission)
- [Prepare dataset description file](../prepare-metadata/create-dataset-description)
- [Prepare subjects file](../prepare-metadata/create-subjects) (required only if your study includes subjects)
- [Prepare samples file](../prepare-metadata/create-samples) (required only if your study includes samples)

### Organize dataset according to the SPARC Dataset Structure

These steps can be completed in the `Organize Dataset` tab of SODA.

- [Specify files and metadata files to be included in your dataset and generate dataset directly on Pennsieve](../prepare-dataset/organize-dataset)

### Submit Dataset to the Curation Team for Review

These steps can be completed in the `Disseminate Dataset` tab of SODA.

- [Share with the Curation Team to add your dataset to their queue for review](../disseminate-dataset/share-with-curation-team) (it is highly suggested to not make any changes after this step until you are contacted by the Curation Team)

### Post-curation steps to be completed ONLY after dataset is approved by the Curation Team

These steps can be completed in the `Disseminate Dataset` tab of SODA.

- [Share dataset with the SPARC Consortium as Embargoed dataset](../disseminate-dataset/share-with-sparc-consortium)
- [Send dataset for pre-publishing review](../disseminate-dataset/submit-for-pre-publishing-review)
