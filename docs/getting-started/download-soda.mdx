   System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General Tab. At the bottom it should say "SODA for SPARC was blocked from use...". Click on the "Open anyway" button next to it. Try opening SODA again and it should now work.

Since our Linux SODA app is in the AppImage format, you can move this file anywhere on your computer and run it. If you would like to move the app into the applications older, we recommend you use the open-source [AppImage Launcher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to organize and handle all AppImage programs for your Linux system.
