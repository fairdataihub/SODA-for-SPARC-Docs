:::note
When uploading datasets with large amounts of files, a dataset upload may take longer than expected. This is regardless of the total storage size of your dataset. In the event of an unsuccessful dataset upload you will receive an error notification. You can trust that as long as there is no error notification SODA is uploading your dataset.
