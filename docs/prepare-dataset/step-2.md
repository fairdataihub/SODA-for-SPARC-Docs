# Step 2: Specify high level folders

Select the high-level folder(s) to be included in your dataset. Refer to the description provided in the figure about the content of each folder to determine which folder you need for your dataset. A high-level folder can only be included from Step 2 and removed from Step 3. You can always come back to this step to include more folders. If you started with an existing dataset (local or Pennsieve), any high-level folder included in that dataset will be automatically selected.
