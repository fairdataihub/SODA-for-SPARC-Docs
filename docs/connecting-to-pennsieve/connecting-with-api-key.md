## Background

SODA provides two methods to connect your Pennsieve account: using your Pennsieve username and password or utilizing an API key generated on Pennsieve.

:::note
If you sign in to Pennsieve with your **ORCiD account**, please refer to the [section on "Connecting to Pennsieve with a Pennsieve API key"](##connecting-to-pennsieve-with-a-pennsieve-api-key).

### Connecting to Pennsieve with a Username and Password

If your Pennsieve account is not yet connected to SODA, you will be prompted to sign in to Pennsieve when you open SODA. To establish the connection, simply enter your Pennsieve **Email Address** and **Password**, then click the `Connect to Pennsieve` button.

### Connecting to Pennsieve with a Pennsieve API Key

To connect your Pennsieve account using an API key, you need to generate an API key on Pennsieve. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Pennsieve account](https://app.pennsieve.io/).
2. On the bottom left of the Pennsieve interface, hover over your account details and select 'View My Profile.'
3. In the API Keys section, click the 'Create API Key' button.
4. You will be prompted to enter a name for your API key. We recommend choosing a memorable key name, but the specific name you choose is not critical.

Once your API key is created, open SODA. You will be given the option to sign in with an API key via the 'Connect with API key instead' button. Click it and use the API key name you created the API key with, the API key, and the secret to log in to SODA.
