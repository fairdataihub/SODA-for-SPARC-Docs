To connect your Pennsieve account using an API key, you need to generate an API key on Pennsieve. Follow these steps to generate an API key:

1. Log in to your [Pennsieve account](https://app.pennsieve.io/).
2. On the bottom left of the Pennsieve interface, hover over your account details and select 'View My Profile.'
3. In the API Keys section, click the 'Create API Key' button.
4. You will be prompted to enter a name for your API key. We recommend choosing a memorable key name, but the specific name you choose is not critical.

Once your API key is created, open SODA. To sign in with your API key, follow these steps:

1. Open SODA AND Click on a feature that requires you to sign in (e.g. Create a new dataset) under Manage Datasets.
2. Click on the **Conncect with API key instead ** button. You will be presented an interface to sign in with your API key like the one below:
   ![](https://github.com/fairdataihub/SODA-for-SPARC/blob/main/docs/documentation/Connect-to-pennsieve/pennsieve-api-key-sign-in.png?raw=true)
3. Enter the name of the key you created as the key name, as well as the API key and API secret generated by Pennsieve.
4. Click **Connect to Pennsieve** to connect your Pennsieve account to SODA.

:::note

- During subsequent uses, SODA will automatically connect to the Pennsieve account you connected with your API key.
- Neither the SODA Team nor anyone else besides you will have access to your API key and secret. The API key and secred will be stored locally on your computer only.
