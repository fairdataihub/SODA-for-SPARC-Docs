:::note

- During subsequent uses, SODA will automatically connect to the Pennsieve account you were connected to the last time.
- Neither the SODA Team nor anyone else besides you will have access to your Pennsieve account. The generated login information required for future sessions on your Pennsieve account will be stored locally on your computer only.
