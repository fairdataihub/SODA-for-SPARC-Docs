## Background

If you're using an API key to sign in, SODA currently doesn't offer a built-in way to switch between organizations within the application. Therefore, you'll need to perform some necessary steps on your Pennsieve account.

## To Change Workspaces:

1. Make sure SODA is not running.
2. Sign in to your [Pennsieve account](https://app.pennsieve.io/).
3. In the bottom left corner of the Pennsieve interface, hover over your account details, and select 'Switch to Private Workspace.'
4. Choose the workspace you would like to use in SODA when you open it back up.
5. **Important:** Follow the instructions [here](../../common-errors/deleting-pennsieve-config-files) to delete your Pennsieve config files.
6. After deleting your Pennsieve config files, open SODA, and it will automatically switch to your new workspace.
