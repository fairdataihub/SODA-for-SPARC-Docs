Manifest files are mandatory for all datasets.

For uploads going to a new Pennsieve dataset, simply toggle the option to `Yes`. Then a **manifest.xlsx** file will be added
to each high-level SPARC folder with the `filename`, `timestamp`, and `file type` fields automatically populated in the correct format while the `description` and
`Additional Metadata` fields can be added by the user by selecting on a high-level folder to make manifest edits. Upon making edits, hitting the save and exit button
will create manifest.xlsx files to be added upon dataset generation.
