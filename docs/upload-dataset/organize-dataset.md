## Background

:::info
At the moment the upload dataset feature is for users who want to upload their dataset to Pennsieve. If you want to
conform your dataset with the Sparc Dataset Structure (SDS) without uploading to Pennsieve, please use the Prepare Dataset Step-by-Step feature.
:::

All datasets SODA helps curate must follow the top level SPARC folder structure imposed by the
[SPARC Dataset Structure](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EQPn1FmANpPsFt3CguU-JOQVMMlJsNXluQAK_gb2qVg/edit#slide=id.p1). This top level folder structure is shown in the figure below. If your data organization doesn't follow this structure inherently, you can use the `Prepare Dataset Step-by-Step` to structure your dataset according to the SDS guidelines.
