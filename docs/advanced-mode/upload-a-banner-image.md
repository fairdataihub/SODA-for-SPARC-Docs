## Background

All SPARC datasets must have the following metadata on Pennsieve: subtitle, description, banner image, license, and tags. This interface allows you to easily add a banner image to your Pennsieve dataset. This image will be associated with the dataset and used as a thumbnail once the dataset is published on the [SPARC data portal](https://sparc.science/).

:::caution
Only .PNG, .JPEG, and .TIFF images are allowed to be used as a banner.

## How to

To access this interface click on the `Advanced Features` at the bottom of the homepage, then click on the `Upload a banner image` card.

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](../connecting-to-pennsieve/connecting-with-username-password). Any existing banner image for your Pennsieve dataset will be automatically imported in the interface.
2. Select/confirm your Workspace. Learn more about workspaces [here](../how-to/how-to-use-workspaces).
3. Click on `Edit banner image`
4. Click on `Import image` in the new pop-up window.
5. Select the image file you want to use as a banner image.
6. Crop the file as desired.

   :::info
   All banner images must be square, have a minimum display size of _512x512 px_ (_1024x1024 px_ preferred), and have a maximum size of _2048x2048 px_.
   If the image exceeds in dimensions SODA can scale the image down automatically.

7. Click on `Save changes`. The newly added banner image will be displayed in the interface.
