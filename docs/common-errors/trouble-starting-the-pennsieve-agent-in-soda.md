## Issue Background

**The Pennsieve Agent failed to start** issue happens when the Pennsieve Agent is installed and SODA is able to interact with the agent, but the agent is not able to successfully start.

## Solution

We recommend that you first follow the troubleshooting steps on [Pennsieve's documentation](https://docs.pennsieve.io/docs/troubleshooting-uploading-data). If you are able to successfully start the agent via the command line after following Pennsieve's troubleshooting steps, please restart SODA and check if SODA is able to successfully start the agent.

If following the troubleshooting steps does not resolve the issue, please [reach out to the SODA team](https://docs.sodaforsparc.io/docs/next/common-errors/sending-log-files-to-soda-team).
