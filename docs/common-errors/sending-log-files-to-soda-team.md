## Background

The SODA app saves all errors in several log files on your computer. In order to solve user issues, the SODA Team usually needs to take a look at those log files.

## How to obtain the log files

# Automatically

To automatically gather your log files:

1. Select the `Contact Us` tab in the navigation menu.
2. Click `Gather Logs` and then select a location store the log files.
3. They will be stored in a folder called `SODA-For-SPARC-Logs`

# Manually

To manually gather log files:

1. Windows: _C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Roaming\SODA for SPARC\logs_
2. macOS: _~/your-username/Library/Logs/SODA_
3. Ubuntu: _/home/your-username/.config/SODA/logs_

## Common issues regarding the log files

Unable to find the AppData (Windows), .config (Ubuntu), or Library (macOS) folder
