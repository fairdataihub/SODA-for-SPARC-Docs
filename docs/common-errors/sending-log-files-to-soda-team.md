## Background

The SODA app saves all errors in several log files on your computer. In order to solve user issues, the SODA Team usually needs to take a look at those log files.

## How to obtain the log files

To automatically gather your log files:

1. Select the `Contact Us` tab in the navigation menu/sidebar.
2. Click `Gather Logs` and then select a location to store the log files.
3. They will be stored in a folder called `SODA-For-SPARC-Logs` at the location selected in step 2.

## How to send the log files to the SODA team

Unless instructed otherwise by the SODA team, you can email the log files with an explanation of your issue at help@fairdataihub.org
