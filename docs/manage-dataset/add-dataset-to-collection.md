## Background

A collection allows you to associate and consolidate multiple datasets into a single grouping. By doing so, you can catalog your datasets in a myriad of ways, including by scientific theme, by publication, and more. Ultimately, this can allow for better organization of your datasets and provides the ability to streamline collaboration by providing a link to a collection instead of multiple, distinct datasets.

## How to

To access this interface click on the `Free Form Mode` side bar option, then click on the `Manage Datasets` tab, and finally click on the `Add/edit tags` card.

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Add, edit, or delete tags:
   - Enter any collection name you feel capture the nature of your research as a collection name. Once you have entered the text for a single collection name, press `Enter` or click off the textbox to add it.
   - Edit existing collection names by double clicking them to change their text. Press `Enter` or click off the textbox to finalize the edit.
   - Delete a tag by clicking the `x` to the right of a given tag.
3. Click on the `Update collections` button.

:::info
All collection names that belong to the organization will be shown as an option.
