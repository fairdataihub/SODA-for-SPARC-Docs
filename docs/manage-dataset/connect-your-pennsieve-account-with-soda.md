# Connect your Pennsieve account with SODA

## Background

SPARC uses the Pennsieve platform to store data and metadata files as well as append additional metadata. All SPARC researchers must thus share their data on Pennsieve. When using SODA for the first time, you will have to connect your Pennsieve account with SODA to use Pennsieve related functionalities implemented in SODA.

SODA will automatically check and see if you have an associated account with Pennsieve when you open the application. If we find an account on your system (i.e you have used SODA or the Pennsieve Agent previously) you should be all set. If an account is not found you can use your Pennsieve login details and allow SODA to retrieve the necessary information to connect to your Pennsieve account.

## How to

1. Click on any features (e.g. Create a new dataset) under Manage Datasets.
2. Click on the edit symbol next to "Current account".
3. Fill in your Pennsieve "Email Address" and "Password" and click "Connect to Pennsieve"

## Note

- During subsequent uses, SODA will automatically connect to the Pennsieve account you were connected to the last time.
- Neither the SODA Team nor anyone else besides you will have access to your Pennsieve account. The generated login information required for future sessions on your Pennsieve account will be stored locally on your computer only.
- If you do not wish to provide your login details to SODA, you can create a set of API keys on Pennsieve and provide it to SODA. Instructions for this process can be found at Connect your Pennsieve account with SODA (API Key)
