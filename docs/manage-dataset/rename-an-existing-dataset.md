## Background

This feature allows you to change an existing Pennsieve dataset's name. The name of the dataset will be displayed as the title of the dataset when the dataset becomes public.
It is thus advised to make sure that your dataset title is different than your other dataset titles and that it is relatively informative.

## How to

1. In `Free Form Mode`, navigate to the `Rename an existing dataset` page from the `Manage Datasets` tab.
2. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
3. Select the `Current dataset` pencil/field and choose one of your Pennsieve datasets that you would like to rename.
4. Enter a new name in the input field and click `Rename dataset`.

:::note
You can only change the name of a dataset that you've created or that you've been given permissions to edit. See [Add edit permissions](./add-edit-permissions) for more details on permissions.
