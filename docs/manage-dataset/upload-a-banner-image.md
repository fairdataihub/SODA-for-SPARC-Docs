# Upload a banner image

## Background

All SPARC datasets must have the following metadata on Pennsieve: subtitle, description, banner image, and license. This interface allows you to easily add a banner image to your dataset. This image will be associated with the dataset and used as a thumbnail once the dataset is published.

## How to

1. Select/confirm your Pennsieve account and dataset. If you have not connected your Pennsieve account with SODA yet, [use the instructions available here](./connect-your-pennsieve-account-with-soda).
2. Click on `Edit banner image`
3. Click on `Import image` in the new pop-up window.
4. Select the image file you want to use as a banner image.
5. Crop the file as desired. Note that all banner images must be square, have a minimum display size of _512x512 px_ (_1024x1024 px_ preferred), and have a maximum file size of 5 MB.
6. Click on `Save changes`.
