# Create Manifest files

## Background

Manifest files are mandatory for all datasets. To learn more about this metadata file we refer to our corresponding "[How to](../how-to/how-to-structure-the-manifest-metadata-file.md)" page.

This section will allow you to generate manifest files for your pre-existing datasets stored locally and on Pennsieve.

:::tip
If you do not have pre-existing datasets SODA allows you to create a new dataset and generate manifest files at the same time. [Instructions are provided here](../prepare-dataset/organize-dataset.md).

## How to

1. You can start by either choosing to generate a manifest file for a pre-existing dataset stored on your local computer or on Pennsieve.
2. Select where the manifest files will be generated.
   - For local datasets user the `Browse here` input to point SODA to your dataset's location.

   - For Pennsieve datasets use the dropdown to select which Pennsieve dataset you would like to create Manifest files for.

3. (Optional) You can edit SODA-generated manifest files by clicking on `Yes, let's edit the manifest files`. SODA allows you to add Description or Additional Metadata to manifest files before generating them to the desired destination. Otherwise, simply click `No, generate now` to proceed.

4. Click `Generate`

:::tip
When you are in the manifest file's editing interface, click on the arrow symbol next to a folder to expand it.
