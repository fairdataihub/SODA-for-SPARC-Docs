## Background

Here are some examples of features of SODA that can be tested without access to the Pennsieve platform.

## Example 1: Using Prepare Dataset Step-by-Step

SODA has been designed to help users who are not SPARC researchers to prepare a Sparc Dataset Structure (SDS) compliant dataset. This feature can be used to prepare a dataset for sharing on the SPARC Portal or a generalist repository like Zenodo.

### Testing this feature

1. Navigate to the Prepare Dataset Step-by-Step feature of SODA. To get there from the home page of SODA, click the "Prepare Dataset Step-by-Step" button.
2. Select the "Prepare and optionally share a new dataset" option.
3. Follow the steps to prepare a dataset. You can save your progress at any time by clicking the "Save & Exit" button at the bottom right of the page.
4. Once you have prepared your dataset, you can choose to generate it locally on your computer. You should have a SDS compliant dataset (or one that is very close in structure and metadata) on your computer.

## Example 3: Download SPARC metadata templates

SODA provides a feature that allows users to download the latest version of the metadata files required in the SDS so they can be reviewed and filled out manually outside of SODA if desired.

### Testing SPARC metadata template downloads

1. Navigate to the Download Templates feature of SODA. To get there from the home page of SODA, click the "Free Form Curation" button, select the Prepare Metadata tab at the top of the page, and then
   click the "Download templates" button.
2. Select the metadata file that you would like to download to your computer, and then select the location to save it to.
