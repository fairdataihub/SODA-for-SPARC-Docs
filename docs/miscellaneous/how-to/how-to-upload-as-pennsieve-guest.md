## Background

SODA supports uploading datasets to Pennsieve for users that only have guest access to a Pennsieve workspace.
However, due to the Pennsieve permissions a guest user cannot create their own dataset on Pennsieve. Instead, they will need to have a dataset created for them by a contributor or associate who has the appropriate permissions to create datasets in the workspace. This contributor or associate may be a colleague or team member who has the necessary access rights. For many the contributor or associate will be a member of the SPARC curation team.

This page shows you how to upload a dataset as a Pennsieve guest using SODA.

## Steps to Upload to a dataset shared with you using the Prepare Dataset Step by Step feature

1. From the homepage click the `Upload Dataset` button.
2. Import your dataset into SODA.
3. Connect your account to Pennsieve if you have not already done so. Confirm that you are connected to the correct workspace. Instructions on how to switch workspaces can be found [here](./how-to-use-workspaces.md).
4. Select 'Update existing dataset' and choose the dataset that was shared with you from the dropdown menu.
5. Follow the remaining steps and upload your dataset to Pennsieve.

:::info
Pennsieve datasets are associated with workspaces. If you have access to multiple workspaces you may want to switch to the appropriate workspace before proceeding. Instructions on how to switch workspaces can be found [here](./how-to-use-workspaces.md).
