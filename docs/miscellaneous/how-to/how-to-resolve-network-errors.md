## Background

Some users encounter network errors when using SODA that happen outside of their control. This page provides some guidance on how to resolve these errors.

## Common Network Issues and Solutions

### Issue: No Internet Connection

If SODA cannot connect to the internet, it will not be able to upload datasets or access online resources. Ensure that your device is connected to a stable internet connection. You can check your connection by opening a web browser and visiting a website.

### Issue: Firewall or Proxy Settings

If you are behind a firewall or using a proxy server, it may block SODA's access to the internet. You may need to configure your firewall or proxy settings to allow SODA to connect. Consult your IT department for assistance if needed.

For example, tools like Netskope can be configured to block SODA's access to the internet. If you are using such a tool, please check with your IT department to ensure that SODA is allowed to connect.
