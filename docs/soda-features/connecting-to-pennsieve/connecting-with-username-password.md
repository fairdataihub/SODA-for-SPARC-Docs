## Background

SPARC uses the [Pennsieve](https://app.pennsieve.net/) platform to store data and metadata files as well as append additional metadata. All SPARC researchers must thus share their data on Pennsieve.
In order to access the Pennsieve platform in SODA you will need to connect your Pennsieve account with SODA. This page will guide you through the process of connecting your Pennsieve account with SODA using your Pennsieve username and password.

:::info
If you are not a SPARC or RE-JOIN funded researcher and want to upload your dataset to a generalist repository (e.g., Zenodo) instead of Pennsieve you can disregard this page and skip to the instructions for
generating a SPARC Data Structure (SDS) compliant dataset on your computer [here](../guided).
:::

## Prerequisite

You will need a Pennsieve account with access to the Pennsieve workspace where you need to upload your data (e.g., SPARC, RE-JOIN, etc.) before connecting your Pennsieve account with SODA. If you do not have a Pennsieve account and/or access to the right Pennsieve workspace, follow the instructions available [here](../../miscellaneous/how-to/how-to-get-a-pennsieve-account).

## Connecting with an username/password

To connect your Pennsieve account using a username and password, follow these steps:

1. Open SODA.
2. Click the **Manage Accounts** page in the sidebar.
3. Click the `Connect Your Pennsieve Account` button in the `Account Options` table.
4. Enter your Pennsieve username and password in the pop-up window that appears.
5. Click `Connect to Pennsieve`.

:::note

- During subsequent uses, SODA will automatically connect to the Pennsieve account you were connected to the last time.
- The SODA team does not have access to your Pennsieve credentials.
- If you want to connect to a different Pennsieve account, you can disconnect your current account in the `Account Options` table and then repeat the steps above with new credentials.
