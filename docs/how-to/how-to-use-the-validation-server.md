## Background

SODA has a companion validation server that can be used to validate your dataset according to the official SPARC Dataset Structure (SDS).
This guide will walk you through starting the validation server and using it alongside SODA-for-SPARC to validate your SPARC datasets.
NOTE: For instructions on installing the validation server see the [How to install the validation server](./how-to-install-the-validation-server.md) page.

## How to

In order to validate a dataset in SODA for SPARC you must first start the validation server.

### Running the validation server on Windows

- Start the validation server either by hitting the Windows key and typing "SODA-for-SPARC-Validation-Server" or by navigating to the installation location and
  double-clicking the executable.

### Running the validation server on Mac

- Start the validation server either by navigating to the Applications folder location and double clicking the `Validation Server` executable.

### Running the validation server on Linux

- Start the validation server either by navigating to the /usr/bin folder location and double clicking the `Validation Server` executable.

## Next Steps

You are ready to validate your datasets! To validate your dataset in Free Form Mode: simply follow the on-screen instructions in SODA-for-SPARC that are found in the `Organize dataset` and `Validate dataset` cards. To validate your dataset in Guided Mode: simply work through the curation process until you reach the `Validate Dataset` step. You will be given on-screen instructions on how to validate your dataset.
