# Submit for pre publishing review

## Background

One year after the dataset completion date (as per the Data
Deliverables document), or right after publishing results from the
dataset, whichever comes first, you must publish your dataset to
Pennsieve Discover, which populates the SPARC Data Portal, and make it
public.

As per the SPARC publishing process, when ready for publishing, you
must submit your dataset for review again to the Curation Team who
will make a final check of your dataset and accept or reject the
publication request. If accepted, the dataset will be published
automatically on Pennsieve Discover by default.Otherwise, the Curation
Team will inform you of the reasons for rejecting. While the dataset
is under review it will become locked until the submission is
withdrawn, rejected, or approved.

When publishing a dataset you may choose to do so under an embargo
that lifts at a selected time up to one year in advance. While a
published dataset is under embargo, it is not visible to the public.
Publishing under embargo can be useful for researchers who want to
provide easy access to collaborators without making their dataset
public; or to researchers who have intellectual property concerns.

- Click the "Submit" button once all checklist items are complete.
  - Select an embargo date or choose to make your dataset available to the
    public immediately after publication. As per SPARC guidelines, you may
    select an embargo date up to one year in advance.
